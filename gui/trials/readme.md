these examples are taken from http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/ch-Introduction.html
most of the code is kept the same. since I have typed them again for the
purposes of learning, didn't include the original comments in the code. for
complete code you should look at the above link.
The comments have been added as per my understanding and I have ignored things that I already knew. 


# issues with code
the code is not pep 8 compliant.
this was implemented for learning purposes and not for production/general use and hence not worried much about the code quality.
