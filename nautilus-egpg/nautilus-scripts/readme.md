### how to run
- just copy these scripts to ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/  
- the script should have executable permissions  
`chmod +x egpg_*.sh`  
- for these scripts to work, i am basically launcing these commands within
a gnome terminal instance so that egpg can take inputs like password etc from the terminal 
this is just a work arround as i really wanted to implement these in bash
this limitation can easily be overcome if i use python

### requirements
- nautilus
- egpg
- gnome-terminal
